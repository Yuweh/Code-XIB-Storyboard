## CoreGraphics101

In Core Graphics, you define a path that tells Core Graphics the line to trace (like two straight lines for the plus) or the line to fill (like the circle which should be filled here). If you’re familiar with Illustrator or the vector shapes in Photoshop, then you’ll easily understand paths.

There are three fundamentals to know about paths:

A path can be stroked and filled.
A stroke outlines the path in the current stroke color.
A fill will fill up a closed path with the current fill color.
